## Materials
  * __Recommended Material for 3D Printing:__ ABS or ASA plastic for durability and weather resistance.
  * __Mounting Hardware:__ Uses #6 x 1-5/8 in. #2 Phillips Bugle Head Drywall screws for mounting to the wall.

## Features
  * __Secure Fit:__ The bracket is designed to snugly hold the cargo cover, ensuring that it doesnâ€™t slip or fall once mounted.
